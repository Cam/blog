# My new blog & Anchor CMS

##### 10th Sep, 2013 by [Cam][1]

<s>My new blog is built on</s> the rather awesome [Anchor CMS][2]. I strongly recommend checking it out if you are looking for something simple, light, fast and flexible.

<s>This theme is based on the default theme that comes with the installation</s>

I custom built my own theme using my [Anchor Skeleton Theme framework, available on Github][3]. You can see some screenshots on [Anchor Themes][4]

#### Update 18/09/2018

This blog is now hosted on Github Pages
