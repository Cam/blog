# Fancy Safari extension

I've always wanted a Safari extension for [Fancy][3]. Fancy don't offer one, and nobody else seems to be making one. So I made one myself. It's very basic, but it works just fine.

[Download the Fancy Safari Extension here][4].

When clicked, the extension will open a new tab with the title and URL of the page filled in for you and the option to; choose an image, choose a category, and add a comment.

It's also retina ready.

To see how I made it, read my previous post ["Make Your Own Safari Extensions"][5]
