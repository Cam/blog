# Easy justified inline menus

##### 8th Mar, 2014 by [Cam][1]

It's really easy to build a justified inline menu using inline lists and a little bit of CSS. This is really useful for creating menus that fill the full width of your site, without having to worry about spacing or support for different screen sizes (responsive design).

## Demo

This is a really basic little demo. Open it up in [JSFiddle][2] to play around with resizing the viewport, to see how it will respond to different screen sizes.

<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/cam/g9h5R/embedded/css,result/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allowpaymentrequest frameborder="0"></iframe>

Style it up however you want, and you have a really simple full width responsive menu.
